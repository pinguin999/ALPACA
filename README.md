## These tools make ALPACA possible

- [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/) is used for all graphic assets and animations.
- [JNGL](https://github.com/jhasse/jngl) is the cross platform game library that makes it possible to publish to Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PC, Mac, iOS, Android and the Web.
- [Schnack](https://gitlab.com/pac4/schnack) is a node based dialog editor.
- [Rhubarb](https://github.com/DanielSWolf/rhubarb-lip-sync) for creation of lip sync information from audio files.
- [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) is the scripting language used for game logic.

All these tools are managed by a Python asset pipeline with file watchers for fast reloading of changes into the game.

## Getting Started

Everything in ALPACA is organized in scenes. And we already provide two demo scenes, you can easily modify. The scene is defined in the data-src/scenes/test_chamber_one.json file.

```json
{
    "items": [
        {"spine": "banana", "x":"330.0", "y":"400.0", "scale": 0.3, "skin": "normal"},
    ],
    "backgroundMusic": "audio/ingame-action.ogg",
    "background": {"spine": "scene1"},
    "zBufferMap": null
}
```

In this demo scene you have a background and one item. You can change the x and y coordinates of the item or duplicate it.

If you want to **add a new item**, you first have to create a new Spine project and save it in date-src. More details in the [docs](https://alpaca-engine.de/).

If you want to **create a third scene**, you just have to create a new file or duplicate the test_chamber_one.json and change it to your needs.

## Build ALPACA from source

### Linux und macOS

```bash
cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
```

### Windows

Install [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) and please make sure to select **Desktop development with C++** while installing.

Then you only need to choose **Open a local folder** and open the ALPACA folder.
Visual Studio will automatically run CMake and you can choose pac.exe as target and press F5 to build and start the game.
